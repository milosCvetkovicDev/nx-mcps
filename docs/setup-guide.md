# MCP Server Support in NX Workspace - Setup Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **MCP SDK Integration**
- Installed `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` as a workspace dependency
- Configured TypeScript to support ES modules and NodeNext resolution

### 2. **MCP Server Architecture**

The workspace supports two approaches for creating MCP servers:

#### Applications (Recommended) - in `apps/` folder
- Standalone MCP server applications
- Have their own `main.ts` entry point
- Can be built and run independently
- Best for production deployments

#### Libraries (Alternative) - in `packages/` folder
- Can be used as shared MCP components
- Or configured as executable libraries
- Good for sharing code between servers

For practical examples of MCP servers, see the **[Server Examples](./server-examples.md)** documentation which includes:
- Database Query Server
- File System Operations Server
- API Gateway Server
- Code Analysis Server
- And more production-ready implementations

### 3. **Workspace Generator**
Created a workspace generator template in `tools/generators/mcp-app/` with:
- Full MCP server scaffolding
- Support for stdio and HTTP transports
- Complete TypeScript configuration
- Test setup with Vitest
- ESLint configuration
- Comprehensive documentation template

### 4. **Documentation**
- `development-guide.md` - Complete guide for MCP development in NX
- Individual README files for each server
- API documentation for all tools, resources, and prompts

## 🚀 How to Use

### Creating New MCP Servers

1. **Manual Creation (Currently Recommended)**:
```bash
# Create as application in apps/ folder
npx nx g @nx/js:library --name=my-server --directory=apps/my-server --projectNameAndRootFormat=as-provided --bundler=tsc

# Then:
# 1. Move src/index.ts to src/main.ts
# 2. Implement MCP server in main.ts
# 3. Create project.json with application configuration
# 4. Update package.json with bin entry
```

2. **Using Generator Templates**:
- Templates are ready in `tools/generators/mcp-app/`
- Can be adapted for local plugin approach (recommended by NX)

### Building and Running

```bash
# Build a server
nx build [server-name]

# Run in development
nx serve [server-name]

# Run built server
node dist/apps/[server-name]/src/main.js
```

### Testing
```bash
nx test [server-name]
nx lint [server-name]
```

## 🔑 Key Features

1. **Full TypeScript Support**
   - ES modules configuration
   - NodeNext module resolution
   - Strict type checking

2. **NX Integration**
   - Build caching
   - Dependency graph
   - Parallel execution
   - Test automation

3. **MCP Protocol Implementation**
   - Tools for actions
   - Resources for data access
   - Prompts for LLM interactions
   - Multiple transport options

4. **Development Experience**
   - Hot reload with `nx serve`
   - Comprehensive testing setup
   - ESLint integration
   - Structured project layout

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Create MCP servers as applications** in the `apps/` folder
2. **Use TypeScript** for type safety
3. **Include comprehensive tests** for handlers
4. **Document all tools, resources, and prompts**
5. **Handle errors gracefully** with meaningful messages
6. **Use semantic versioning** for server versions

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **For Production**:
   - Add environment configuration
   - Implement proper logging
   - Add authentication if needed
   - Deploy as containerized services

2. **For Development**:
   - Create more specialized MCP servers
   - Share common utilities as libraries
   - Add integration tests
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines

The workspace is now fully configured for building, testing, and deploying MCP servers using the Model Context Protocol!
