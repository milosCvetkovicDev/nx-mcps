# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the MCP workspace. ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during the development of this project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures:
- **Context**: The situation and forces at play
- **Decision**: The change we're proposing or have agreed to implement
- **Consequences**: What happens after applying the decision

## ADR Status

- **Proposed**: Under discussion
- **Accepted**: Approved and implemented
- **Deprecated**: No longer relevant but kept for history
- **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR

## Current ADRs

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [001](./001-typescript.md) | Use TypeScript for MCP Development | Accepted | 2023-11-15 |
| [002](./002-nx-monorepo.md) | Adopt Nx for Monorepo Management | Accepted | 2023-11-16 |
| [003](./003-transport-protocols.md) | Support Multiple Transport Protocols | Accepted | 2023-11-20 |
| [004](./004-error-handling.md) | Standardized Error Handling Strategy | Accepted | 2023-11-25 |
| [005](./005-testing-strategy.md) | Comprehensive Testing Approach | Accepted | 2023-12-01 |
| [006](./006-plugin-architecture.md) | Plugin System Design | Proposed | 2024-01-10 |

## ADR Template

When creating a new ADR, use this template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
What is the issue we're seeing that motivates this decision?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

### Positive
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

### Negative
- Drawback 1
- Drawback 2

### Neutral
- Change 1
- Change 2

## References
- Link to relevant documentation
- Related ADRs
- External resources
```

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy the template above
2. Create a new file: `XXX-descriptive-name.md`
3. Fill in all sections
4. Submit for review via pull request
5. Update this README once accepted

## Best Practices

1. **Keep ADRs concise**: Focus on the decision, not implementation details
2. **Be specific about trade-offs**: Clearly state both benefits and drawbacks
3. **Link related decisions**: Reference other ADRs when relevant
4. **Include stakeholders**: Get input from affected parties
5. **Date your decisions**: Track when decisions were made

## Why We Use ADRs

- **Historical context**: Understand why decisions were made
- **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand the architecture
- **Accountability**: Document who made decisions and when
- **Evolution**: Track how the architecture has changed over time
